# SQL Query runner [ðŸ”—](https://sql-query-insights.netlify.app/)

This is a web-based SQL query runner demo application built using `react`, along with `Tailwindcss` for styling, `antd` for table and `codemirror` for sql editor. It allows users to execute SQL queries in a web-based editor and see the results generated in the form of table.

## Data 
The mock data used in the application is obtained from [graphql-compose-examples](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-examples/tree/master/examples/northwind/data/csv) repo.

## Optimisations
Several optimizations have been done in this React project which are:

1. **Implemented Caching in Data Fetching Hook**: Reduced redundant API calls by caching responses, leading to faster data retrieval and less server load.

2. **Used `useMemo` for Expensive Computations**: Optimized performance by memoizing computationally intensive operations, preventing them from being recalculated on every render.

3. **Applied `useCallback` for Functions**: Stabilized function identities across renders, reducing unnecessary re-renders of child components receiving these functions as props.

4. **Dynamically Imported `antd's Table` Component with React Lazy**: Improved initial page load speed by loading the `Table` component from antd only when needed, effectively reducing the initial JavaScript bundle size.

5. **On-Demand Data Fetching**: The data is only fetched from the API when requested by the user, thus decreasing the initial load times of the app and saving unnecessary API calls.
